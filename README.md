# Berkeley CS182/282 Designing, Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks
Self study on CS182/CS282 - Designing, Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks (Spring 2019) @ UC Berkeley. Includes assignments, lecture slides, and lecture notes. Solutions passed all the self-contained unit tests but were not submitted using student-only submission system.

## Assignment1: :heavy_check_mark:
Based on Stanford CS 231n assignment 2. Only Python 2.7 supported. Migrated and completed using Python 3.7.

- Implenentation of fully connected deep neural network for classification using numpy only.

## Assignment2: :heavy_check_mark:
Based on Stanford CS 231n assignment 3. Python 3.5 and 3.6 supported. Done using Python 3.7. Network visualization and style transfer done using `pytorch 1.2`. Also implemented GAN notebook.

- Implementation of image captioning neural network using numpy only.
- Implementation of saliency map using Pytorch.
- Implementation of image style transfer using Pytorch.
- Implemnentation of GAN and DCGAN using using Pytorch.

## Assignment3: :heavy_check_mark:
Done using Python 3.7 and tensorflow 2.0 in `tensorflow.compat.v1` mode. Got 4.54 validation loss with default transformer hyper params vs. possible <= 4.5 indicated in the assignment notebook. Batch size limited by GPU memory.

- Implementation of Transformer from [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), using Tensorflow 1.

## Assignment4: :heavy_check_mark:
Based on assignment 2 and 3  of CS294-112 Deep Reinforcement Learning at UC Berkeley. Python 3.5 and 3.6 supported,`tensorflow 1.10` code base. 

Done using Python 3.7 and Tensorflow 2.0 in `tensorflow.compat.v1` mode. Migraded codes in `train_dqn.py` from `Tensorflow 1.10` to `Tensorflow 1.15`. 

- Implementation of vanilla Policy Gradient, DQN, DDQN.


OpenAI Gym FFMPEG [issue](https://github.com/openai/gym/issues/35) prevented pong from training, causing ```ERROR: VideoRecorder encoder exited with status 1```.

```
dd if=/dev/zero bs=750000 count=50 | ffmpeg -nostats -loglevel error -y -r 60 -f rawvideo -s:v 500x500 -pix_fmt 'rgb24' -i /dev/stdin -vcodec libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p /tmp/foo.mp4

```
After above issue fixed, new error: Not enough memory.
```
MemoryError: Unable to allocate array with shape (1000000, 210, 160, 3) and data type uint8
```
The array shape from provided code is 210x160x3 but in `atari.py` the frames are downsampled to 84x84x1 using `ProcessFrame84`. My Ubuntu box can only fit at most (250000, 210, 160, 3) int8. Since DQN and DDQN looks fine on Cartpole, will save my energy bill and pospond running the training later.
